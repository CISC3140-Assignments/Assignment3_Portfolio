        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a rising senior in the School of Natural and Behavioral Sciences at CUNY-Brookyn College. I am pursuing a major in Computer Science, a minor in Accounting and working towards a masterâ€™s in Data Science. Last summer, I volunteered at Invictus Institute and I was able to showcase my initiative and leadership skills by managing a group of 7 volunteers on a Database System project. We reorganized an Excel sheet in a more efficient and accessible way using SQL and Java.
            In my free time I enjoy working out. Fun fact, I do not need music to work out! I also enjoy supporting my creative friends and organizing events. When I moved from Haiti to NYC three years ago, I did not imagine that my life would be like this. Little to no women pursue a career in tech in my country. I am proud to be one of the first and I am eager to learn and bring these knowledge and resources back to where it all started!
